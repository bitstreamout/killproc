.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkill
determines all active mount points from
.I /proc/mounts
and compares this with the specified mount points. Then
.B mkill
seeks for processes making this mount points busy. For
this search only the links found in
.I /proc/<pid>/
are used to avoid hangs on files provided by network
file systems like
.BR nfs (5).
The default signal is
.B SIGTERM
for termination. If a mount point is not active, that is
that it is not found in
.IR /proc/mounts ,
.B mkill
will do exactly nothing.
